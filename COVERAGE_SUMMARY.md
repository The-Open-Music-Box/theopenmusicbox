## 🐛 **Bugs Fixed This Session**

### Bug #1: mdns_service.py - Decorator Import Error
**File:** `back/app/src/services/mdns_service.py`

**Problem:**
```python
# Decorator used at class level (line 40)
@handle_service_errors("mdns")
def register_service(self):
    ...

# But imported inside __init__ (line 33)
def __init__(self):
    from app.src.services.error.unified_error_decorator import handle_service_errors
```

**Impact:** Module couldn't even be imported - `NameError` on class definition

**Fix:** Moved `handle_service_errors` import to module level

---

### Bug #2: audio_application_service.py - Playlist Constructor Mismatch
**File:** `back/app/src/application/services/audio_application_service.py:84`

**Problem:**
```python
playlist = Playlist(
    name=playlist_data.get("name", ""),  # ❌ Wrong parameter
    ...
)
```

Playlist dataclass requires `title`, not `name`:
```python
@dataclass
class Playlist:
    title: str  # Required parameter
```

**Impact:** Playlist playback completely broken - `TypeError` on every attempt

**Fix:**
```python
playlist = Playlist(
    title=playlist_data.get("title", playlist_data.get("name", "")),  # ✅ Correct + backward compatible
    ...
)
```
