# Session Summary - October 23, 2025

## Overview
Continued test coverage improvement work for TheOpenMusicBox project, focusing on frontend coverage expansion and attempting socketService testing.

---

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments

### 1. Documentation Committed
- **COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md**: Complete project-wide coverage overview
  - Backend: 66.00% (9,173/13,879 lines), 1,716 tests
  - Frontend: 62.06% (8,683/13,989 lines), 447 tests
  - Combined: ~64% coverage
  - Progress tracking and next steps for both projects

### 2. Frontend Coverage Expansion
- **Expanded tracking from 1 file ‚Üí 82 files**
- **vitest.config.mts updated:**
  - Now tracks all `src/**/*.ts` and `src/**/*.vue` files
  - Realistic thresholds (50% lines, 40% branches)
  - Proper exclusions for test files

- **True baseline established: 62.06% statements**

### 3. High Coverage Areas Identified
| Area | Coverage | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `src/utils/` | 99.64% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `src/services/api/` | 96.49% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `src/components/files/` | 95.99% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `src/components/upload/` | 100% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| `src/components/youtube/` | 100% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| `src/stores/unifiedPlaylistStore.ts` | 98.91% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `src/stores/uploadStore.ts` | 100% | ‚úÖ Perfect |

### 4. Critical Gaps Identified
| File | Coverage | Lines | Impact | Priority |
|------|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| `socketService.ts` | 0% | 992 | +7.1% | üî¥ URGENT |
| `nativeWebSocket.ts` | 0% | 512 | +3.7% | üî¥ URGENT |
| `serverStateStore.ts` | 19% | 836 | +4.8% | üî¥ URGENT |

**Total potential: +15.6% ‚Üí 77.6% coverage**

## üîç Challenges Encountered

### socketService.ts Testing Complexity

**Attempted Approach**: Traditional unit testing with extensive mocking

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Service instantiated on module import
2. **Module Initialization Order**: Mocks not applied before constructor runs
3. **Dual-Mode Support**: Socket.IO vs Native WebSocket adds complexity
4. **Deep Dependency Chain**: Requires mocking io, logger, config, NativeWebSocketClient

**Diagnostic Findings**:
- socketConfig correctly mocked: `path: '/socket.io'`
- ESP32 mode correctly detected as `false`
- But `io()` never called (0 calls)
- `logger` never called (constructor didn't run)
- socketService has NativeWebSocketClient interface (wrong mode selected)
- Root cause: Config visible during initialization differs from test-time config

**Conclusion**: socketService requires different testing approach

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

### Short-Term (This Week)
1. **Test easier files first**:
   - `nativeWebSocket.ts` (512 lines) - Similar complexity but not a singleton
   - `serverStateStore.ts` (836 lines, already has 19% coverage)
   - `cacheService.ts` (307 lines, 36% coverage)

2. **socketService Strategy Options**:
   - **Option A**: Integration tests (test actual behavior with real backend)
   - **Option B**: Refactor for testability (dependency injection, factory pattern)
   - **Option C**: E2E tests with Cypress/Playwright
   - **Option D**: Accept lower coverage for now, document as technical debt

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Implement Phase 1 testing for simpler services
2. Review socketService architecture for refactoring opportunities
3. Target: 62% ‚Üí 72% (+10%) by focusing on testable files

### Long-Term (Next Month)
1. Address socketService testability (refactor or integration tests)
2. Component testing for views
3. Target: 72% ‚Üí 85% overall coverage

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Start with simpler tests**: Build confidence and patterns with easier files before tackling complex singletons

2. **Singleton testing is hard**: Services that instantiate on module load require special handling or refactoring

3. **Mock order matters**: With Vitest, ensure mocks are fully configured before module imports

4. **Pragmatic approach**: Sometimes integration tests are better than fighting complex mocks

5. **Documentation value**: Clear baseline and plans enable better decision-making

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Session Plan

1. **Test nativeWebSocket.ts** (512 lines, 0% ‚Üí 80%)
   - Not a singleton, easier to mock
   - Estimated: 40-50 tests
   - Impact: +3.7% total coverage

2. **Test serverStateStore.ts** (836 lines, 19% ‚Üí 80%)
   - Already has some tests to build on
   - Estimated: 50-70 tests
   - Impact: +4.8% total coverage

3. **Decision on socketService**:
   - Research integration testing approaches
   - Or propose refactoring for testability

**Target for next session**: +8.5% coverage (nativeWebSocket + serverStateStore)

**Session Duration**: ~3-4 hours
**Status**: Productive - documentation complete, challenges identified, clear path forward
